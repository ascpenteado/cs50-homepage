                        Joaquina Beach (Praia da Joaquina) Became internationally famous in the 1970s, when surfers from
                        around the world discovered its waves. Joaquina Beach is accessible from the Lagoon of
                        Conceição. Many surf cups began to emerge, and great Catarinense surfing personalities. It is
                        one of the beaches that offers the best tourist facilities,receiving a large number of tourists
                        from around Brazil and the world on the warm days in spring and summer. The rock complex
                        situated to the left of the beach, the night lighting and the public showers are some of the
                        trademarks at Joaquina. There is a big paid parking lot, toilets, tourist coach parking lot,
                        lifeguards, police station, handicraft shop, bars, restaurant and hotels. Sand boards can be

                        Barra da Lagoa Barra da Lagoa is a quaint fisherman's village. The physical characteristics of
                        the beach makes it an ideal place to learn to surf. It is a cove on the Eastern part of the
                        island and stretches into Moçambique beach for 15 kilometres (9.3 mi). It is in a natural
                        setting as there are no huge hotels on the beach and the Southern headquarters of Projeto TAMAR
                        (Save the Turtles) is located here. Penguins swim into the canal and near the beach of Barra da
                        Lagoa during the colder winter months of June, July and August. The canal at Barra da Lagoa
                        connects the Lagoa da Conceição with the open sea. It is not uncommon to see fishermen during
                        the night tossing their nets in the lagoa to catch shrimp they sell to the fresh fish
                        restaurants in this community.

                        Ingleses Beach (Praia dos Ingleses) Even though it is a beach preferred by tourists, Ingleses
                        still keeps to the traditions of the Azorian colonizers. In the summer, it is one of the top
                        beach destinations of Argentine tourists, second only to Canasveiras. In the winter, mullet
                        fishing, religious celebrations and regional festivities are demonstrations of the local
                        culture. The dunes separating the Ingleses Beach (English Beach) from the Santinho Beach are
                        natural attractions not to be missed. The practice of sand board is quite common there, a sport
                        created in Florianópolis, which consists of sliding down the dunes on a board, engaging or not
                        in radical manoeuvres. To practice it, one must have a lot of balance and rent a board. Those
                        looking for a different outing can go on a trek of 4 kilometres (2.5 mi) over the dunes.

                        Armação Beach (Praia da Armação) The Sant'Anna Church, built by the Armação fishing company, is
                        part of the beach's history. It was from there that whale harpooners and crewmen confessed and
                        attended the mass before going fishing. Next, the priest would go down to the beach to bless the
                        boats that would sail out to sea. Today, the boats leave there for Ilha do Campeche, one of the
                        most visited islands around Florianópolis. It is also in Armação that one finds one of the most
                        important archaeological sites of the State of Santa Catarina. In the winter of 2010 a
                        significant portion of the beach disappeared due to erosion. With financial aid from the
                        Brazilian federal government, tons of large rocks were dumped on the beach to prevent houses
                        from destruction.

                        Campeche Beach (Praia do Campeche) With 5 kilometres (3.1 mi) of white sands and a turbulent
                        waters, Campeche is considered the Jeffreys Bay of the Santa Catarina Island for the quality of
                        its waves. For those who are not interested in surfing, the beach offers other attractions. At
                        night, Campeche is also an attraction. The huge reflector that illuminates part of the large
                        sand strip in front of the bars only contributes to the partying that extends far into the
                        night. The illumination favours both those who enjoy the merrymaking as well as the fishermen,
                        who use the time to drag their nets in from the sea.

                        Santinho Beach (Praia do Santinho) is mainly sought by tourists who look for nature, and the
                        location's tranquility. Surfers are the main visitors and consider Santinho to be the best beach
                        in the North of the Santa Catarina Island. It is in the left hand corner, where bathers do not
                        venture, that surfers practice their sport, sharing the space with fishermen. 40 kilometres (25
                        mi) away from the centre of Florianópolis, another attraction of this beach are the primitive
                        inscriptions made by hunters, fishermen and collectors inhabiting the Island five thousand years
                        ago. The name Santinho comes from a human figure engraved on an isolated block of rock.

                        The island is connected to the Continent by three bridges. The Hercílio Luz Bridge that was
                        built in 1926, this bridge is 11 years older than Golden Gate Bridge, but is now closed to
                        traffic; it is a symbol of the island and often appears on postcard images. The Colombo Sales
                        Bridge and Pedro Ivo Bridge are the ones open to traffic.
