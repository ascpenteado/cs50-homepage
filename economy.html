                <h1>Economy in Florianópolis</h1>
                <article>
                    <h2>
                        According to 2002 Sefaz statistics, agricultural activities represented 0.05%, manufacturing
                        represented 3.41% and the sector of the commerce and service 96.54%.
                    </h2>
                    <p>
                        Tourism is one of the staples of Florianópolis' economy, and relates to Floripa's Azorean
                        culture, observed in the buildings, workmanship, folklore, culinary and religious traditions of
                        the area. Its environmental restrictions on building and commercial development have been more
                        or less strictly enforced, helping it to keep its original character.
                    </p>

                    <p>
                        To meet the demands of its academic crowd, the city invested heavily in everything from roads to
                        schools, and now Florianópolis ranks high on every development measure, from literacy (97
                        percent) to electrification (near 100 percent). By the late 1990s, private companies were
                        flocking to the island, or emerging from a technology "incubator" at the federal university.
                        (Among the innovations it hatched: the computerized voting machines that have made Brazilian
                        elections fraud-free and efficient). Local officials now say their aim is to be the Silicon
                        Valley of Brazil, with beaches.
                    </p>

                    <p>
                        In addition to its white sand beaches, Florianópolis offers many historical attractions,
                        including the sites of the original Azorean colonists, the Lagoa da Conceição lagoon, and Santo
                        Antônio de Lisboa. Tourism in Florianópolis has grown significantly over the past 10 years, with
                        increasing numbers of visitors coming from other large cities in Brazil (particularly Porto
                        Alegre, Curitiba, São Paulo and Rio de Janeiro) as well as other South American countries
                        (particularly Argentina, with direct flights offered daily from Buenos Aires).
                    </p>

                    <p>
                        During the past decade technology and software development firms also experienced strong growth,
                        and today Information Technology services are one of the top revenue generators in
                        Florianópolis. Several technology centers are spread around Florianópolis, making the city an
                        important pole in this economic sector.
                    </p>

                    <p>The GDP for the city was R,259,393,000 (2005).</p>

                    <p>The per capita income for the city was R,776 (2005).</p>
