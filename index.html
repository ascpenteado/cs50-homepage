                <h1>Welcome to Florianópolis!</h1>
                <h2>
                    The name Florianópolis was meant to be a tribute to Marshal Floriano Peixoto, the second President
                    (1891–1894) of the Republic of the United States of Brazil and from Greek term polis, meaning
                    "city". Until 1893, the city was called Nossa Senhora do Desterro (Our Lady of Banishment) or simply
                    "Desterro".

                        Florianópolis (Portuguese pronunciation: [floɾi.aˈnɔpolis]) is the capital and second largest
                        city of the state of Santa Catarina, in the South region of Brazil. The city encompasses Santa
                        Catarina Island and surrounding small islands, as well as part of the mainland. It has a
                        population of 477,798, according to the 2016 IBGE (Brazilian Institute of Geography and
                        Statistics) population estimate,[1] the second most populous city in the state (after
                        Joinville), and the 47th in Brazil. The metropolitan area has an estimated population of
                        1,111,702, the 21st largest in the country. The city is known for having the country's third
                        highest Human Development Index score among all Brazilian cities (0.847).[2]

                    <p>
                        The economy of Florianópolis is heavily based on information technology, tourism and
                        services.[3] The city has 60 beaches and is a center of surfing activity. Lagoa da Conceição is
                        the most famous area for tourism, recreation, nature and radical sports. The New York Times
                        reported that "Florianopolis is the Party Destination of the Year in 2009."[4] Newsweek placed
                        Florianópolis in the "Ten most dynamic cities of the world" list in 2006.[5] Veja, a Brazilian
                        publication, named the city as "the best place to live in Brazil."[6] As a result of this
                        exposure, Florianópolis is growing as a second home destination for many Paulistas, Argentines,
                        North Americans, and Europeans.

                        Most of the population lives on the mainland and on the island's central and northern parts. The
                        southern half is less inhabited. Many small commercial fishermen populate the island. The
                        fishing boats, the lacemakers, the folklore, the cuisine and the colonial architecture
                        contribute to the growing tourism and attracts resources that compensate for the lack of any
                        large industry. Villages immersed in tradition and history, such as Santo Antônio de Lisboa and
                        Ribeirão da Ilha still resist the advances of modernity.[7]

                        The Hercílio Luz International Airport serves the city. Florianópolis is home to the
                        Universidade Federal de Santa Catarina (Federal University of Santa Catarina). There are also
                        the Santa Catarina Federal Institute of Education, Science and Technology (Instituto Federal de
                        Santa Catarina), and two campuses of the Universidade do Estado de Santa Catarina (State
                        University of Santa Catarina), among other institutions of higher and professional education.
